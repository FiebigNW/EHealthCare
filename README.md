EHealthCare project provides a system in which a user / company could manage/view a hospital, the hopsital rooms, and the patients.
  This program serves the purpose of data management and the functionality of data management in a Java program.
  While the actualy code serves the purpose of managing a hospital system, it could easily be replaced with different objects within a heirarchy.
  For example, a hospital could be a zoo, hospital rooms could be the habitats, and patients could be the animals.
