//In-Progress Project//

The EHealthCare project provides a system where a user/company can manage/view a hierarchical system.
  This program serves the purpose of data management and the functionality of data management in a Java program.
  While the actual code manages a hospital system, it could easily be replaced with different objects within a hierarchy.
  For example, a hospital could be a zoo, hospital rooms could be the habitats, and patients could be the animals.
